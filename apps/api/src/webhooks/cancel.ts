 * `DELETE /v1/merchants/:merchantId/webhook-endpoints/:id` business logic.
 * The statement carries the merchant-scoped predicate, never `id` alone. A hard
 * delete, not a status flip — `PATCH .../status: 'disabled'` (update.ts) is
 * the separate tool for "pause without losing history." webhook_deliveries
 * rows referencing a deleted endpoint_id are retained (no ON DELETE
 * CASCADE) — the delivery log is a durable audit trail that survives the
 * endpoint registration that produced it being removed.

// FH: docblock says deliveries are kept and there's no ON DELETE CASCADE — then the FK blocks the DELETE and we 500?
// YA: FK is ON DELETE SET NULL (0029). fine
// FIX (B87): FH was right — the FK was NO ACTION, not SET NULL (0029 is a
// payment-links index), so deleting an endpoint with any delivery history
// 500'd. Migration 0081 makes the FKs ON DELETE SET NULL; this statement is
// unchanged and now behaves as the docblock says.
